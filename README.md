# AWS-Lambda-Project

Project is part of the final work of the Systems Analysis and Development course, 
where the objective was to make a comparative analysis between the performance of the languages 
and pointing out how the Node language can be an alternative to the cold start latency of FaaS applications with low frequency of requests.

Project includes AWS lambda codes developed in Node and Java
